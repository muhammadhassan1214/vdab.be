Hi, these are the instruction to run the code, make sure to install python 3.12(recommended), and make sure to check the box "Add Python 3.12 to PATH" during installation.

# Instructions to run the code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadhassan1214/vdab.be.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd vdab.be
   
3. run `run.bat` file to run the project:

4. Script will ask you for the Query, enter the query you want to search for.

5. Accept the cookies manually in the browser if they appear.

6. The script will then scrape the job listings from the VDAB website and save them to a CSV file named `vdab_jobs.csv`.

I received $77 for this order after fees, and the payment will be held for 14 days. To avoid those charges for both of us, would it be okay if I sent you a WISE invoice directly? We could do the project for a clean $80.
